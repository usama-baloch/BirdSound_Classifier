# BirdSound_Classifier

### Problem:
The Problem is to use your machine-learning skills to identify under-studied [Indian bird species](https://stateofindiasbirds.in/) by sound. Specifically, the challenge was to develop computational solutions to process continuous audio data and recognize the species by their calls.

### Data:

You can download the dataset from Kaggle Link: [BirdClef 2024 DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2024/data) and can understand the features and
